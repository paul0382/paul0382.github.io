    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Emma and I'm a student within the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program here at Algonquin College. I'm taking a selection of classes that are teaching me skills that should help me get a job within the design field. Coming to Algonquin was a pivot for me professionally, as I previously worked within the paddlesports industry. I felt inspired to explore myself creatively and am excited to be here. As per a book I once read, <blockquote>"A creative life is an amplified life. It's a bigger life, a happier life, an expanded life, and a hell of a lot more interesting life." <cite>(Gilbert, 2015)</cite><sup>1</sup></blockquote></p>
   <p>Outside of school, my hobbies include strength training, yoga, climbing, cross-country skiing, and hiking. I'd like to try to create a regular exercise schedule for myself so that I'm able to maximize my time doing each activity. I also recently learned to sew and would like to continue growing this skill. In my downtime I enjoy hanging out with friends, watching movies, and reading the occasional book.</p>
